# üöÄ CommunityCoin: Decentralized Treasury for Online Communities

**Tagline:** "Doar f√°cil, ver f√°cil, confiar f√°cil."

## ‚ú® Introduction

CommunityCoin (also known as StellarTreasury) is an innovative bot-driven solution for Discord and Telegram communities, revolutionizing how online groups manage their finances. We address critical pain points faced by communities today:

*   **Complexity of traditional crypto donations:** Difficult for non-technical users.
*   **Lack of real-time spending transparency:** Opaque financial flows erode trust.
*   **Bureaucracy of multi-signature for micro-expenses:** Hinders agility for daily operational needs.

Leveraging the **Stellar blockchain**, CommunityCoin provides a secure, transparent, and user-friendly platform. It empowers community members to **donate effortlessly** via simple chat commands and QR codes, while enabling treasurers to execute **micro-spending instantly** for everyday needs (e.g., server costs, community events) without cumbersome, multi-level approvals. All financial activities are publicly recorded on the Stellar network, reflected on a transparent dashboard, and notified in real-time, fostering unparalleled trust and engagement.

Our solution turns complex financial management into a seamless, integrated chat experience, living up to its promise of "Doar f√°cil, ver f√°cil, confiar f√°cil."

## üåü Key Features (MVP)

For this hackathon, we focused on delivering the core value proposition:

1.  **Effortless Donations via Chat:**
    *   **`/doar <amount> <asset>` command:** Users can initiate donations directly from their Discord/Telegram chat.
    *   **Dynamic QR Code / Stellar Payment Link:** The bot responds with an easy-to-scan QR code and a clickable payment link, allowing any Stellar wallet user to donate in seconds.
    *   **Real-time Public Notifications:** Upon successful donation, the bot announces the contribution in the community channel, fostering transparency and appreciation.

2.  **Instant Micro-Spending for Treasurers:**
    *   **`/gastar <amount> <asset> <recipient_address> <description>` command:** Designated treasurers can execute small expenses directly from the chat.
    *   **Bypass Bureaucracy:** For amounts below a pre-defined threshold, these transactions are processed instantly, demonstrating how common multi-signature overhead for small costs can be avoided.
    *   **Public Spending Notifications:** The bot announces the expenditure in the community channel, including a link to the Stellar transaction on StellarExpert for full auditability.

3.  **Transparent Community Dashboard:**
    *   A simple web-based dashboard provides a clear overview of the treasury's current balance and a list of recent transactions (donations and expenditures).
    *   Each transaction is linked to StellarExpert, ensuring full on-chain verifiability.

## üí° How It Works (High-Level Workflow)

User commands the bot ‚û°Ô∏è Bot interacts with Backend API ‚û°Ô∏è Backend API leverages Stellar SDK to manage transactions on Stellar Network ‚û°Ô∏è Real-time updates pushed back to chat and displayed on web dashboard.

## üõ† Technologies Used

*   **Blockchain Protocol:** [Stellar Network](https://www.stellar.org/) (chosen for its low transaction fees, high speed, native multi-signature capabilities, and robust stablecoin ecosystem)
*   **Stellar SDK:** `js-stellar-sdk` (for all Stellar-related interactions: account management, transaction building, signing, and submission)
*   **Bot Frameworks:**
    *   `discord.js` (for Discord integration)
    *   `telegraf.js` (for Telegram integration)
*   **Backend:** Node.js with Express.js (handling bot commands, orchestrating Stellar API calls, and managing treasurer permissions)
*   **Frontend (Dashboard):** React.js (for the simple, real-time web dashboard)
*   **Database:** MongoDB / Firestore (for storing bot-related metadata like community configurations, treasurer roles, and transaction descriptions)
*   **Stellar Integrations:** StellarExpert API (for fetching real-time account data and providing links for transaction auditability)

## üöÄ Future Enhancements (Beyond Hackathon)

Our vision extends far beyond this MVP. Future developments will include:

*   **Advanced On-Chain Governance (via Soroban):** Implementing quadratic voting, delegated voting, and automated proposal execution.
*   **Seamless Fiat On/Off-Ramps:** Direct integration with local payment providers to easily convert fiat to stablecoins and vice-versa.
*   **NFT-based Reputation & Access:** Using non-fungible tokens on Stellar for community badges, weighted voting, and token-gated access.
*   **Comprehensive Budgeting Tools:** Allowing treasurers to set up "budget boxes" for specific initiatives and track progress towards funding goals.
*   **Enhanced UI/UX:** More interactive elements within Discord/Telegram, richer data visualization on the dashboard.
